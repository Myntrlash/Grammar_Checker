I have build a grammar checker.
The module first takes a sentence preprocesses it and then parses the preprocessed text through Gingerit.
The gingerit Api makes  errors while checking the use of correct prepositions and conjunctions , so in the remaining part i have rectified some of the common preposition and conjuction errors
